#### Reason behind change 

User Feedback on Prototype Version 1.0 was noted, and summarised as follows:

Some users expressed confusion when faced with certain questions, indicating a need for additional contextual information (aka Hint Text) to help them understand what is being asked. This was particularly important because there was a common concern among users about the accuracy of the data they provided.


#### Description

The team redesigned the prototype to address the concern users raised regarding wanting more context, as follows:

The team added more context on the opening screen, in order to provide a wider contextual explanation of why the users needed to enter supplier information, what type of information was to be entered and how this information would be used.  This included the benefit to themselves or their organisation.  In addition to this, all screens where further context appeared to be necessary, were enhanced.  This was determined from user-expressed concerns and/or from witnessing which areas resulted in users delaying their data entry for a longer amount of time than on other screens.

#### Screenshots

The initial screen prior to enhancement contained no context or introductory text.

Following enhancement to reflect user feedback, the initial screen contained considerably more context and other useful introductory text.
