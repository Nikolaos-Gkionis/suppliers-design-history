## Re-designing the Home page 

The Original design for the Account Home page had a summary list pattern with actions on the right hand end of each row. The users expressed doubts on how helpful that was and possibly confusing. Furthermore, there was now way to show to returning users when the last data had been recorded.

### The problem space

Moreover, once a user had submitted a section of the data in the initial journey the return to the account home page did not display whether this section was either in progress, for example an incomplete section or completed.

### Working with tags

In an effort to give visual feedback on progress to the user, within the account home page the team decided to make use of <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/tag" class="govuk-link"> Tags </a> This allowed the user to both visually and audio described.

### Increasing clarity

The next step was to include a timestamp, within each row of the sections. Furthermore, we also brought back information to allow the user the minimum amount of valuable information needed to quickly and at a glance see if they need to make any amendments.

### Next steps

In the third round of research we expect to see improved user experience and more clarity and understanding.
