## The business analysis model

As this is a live service entering a new phase, new features and different journeys are being developed by the business and our BA has provided a model, in a schematics draw.io model. This includes all the relevant branching and allows for the creation of accurate realistic prototyping. Which in turn enhances the usability testing by providing a prototype so close to the service.

Every sub-journey has a model of each own:

- Pre-task list
- Trader details
- Guarantee
- House consignments
- Routes
- Transport

All sub-journeys have or are under the process of having a complete model.

## Screenshot

- The simplest of all the models, is the Pre-task list.

- The second of all the models in simplicity, is the Guarantee journey.
