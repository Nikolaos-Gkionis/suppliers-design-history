## Exploring different design in dashboard variants

#### The thesis

There is a functionality within the project that requires a user to save a declaration and come back to it later. Once the user logs back in they should have presented back to them all the incomplete declarations. This was originally called 'Save, retrieve and amend' simply describing the 3 basic user needs.

Users can view a list of incomplete declarations and perform 2 functions, delete and review.

The prototype includes the 2 final designs to allow the A/B testing, the designs chosen ranged from the most complex to the simplest version.
