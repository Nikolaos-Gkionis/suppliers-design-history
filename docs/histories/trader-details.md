## A sub-journey

This is new section which combines parts from phase 4 sections and allows the users to provide information about the traders, consignors and consignees for their departure declarations.

Users can go through and skip part of this sub-journey as the questions appear to them.

The prototype includes `if/else` statements to allow the check your answers page to surface only the relevant information provided by the user.

## Screenshots

- A radio button option that creates the first branching possibilities that will direct the next step

#### The declaration summary

At the end of the journey the user is then taken back to the declaration summary where they can see that they have completed this section.
