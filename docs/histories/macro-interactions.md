## The user problem

At the very start of the user journey, after 5 to 7 questions the user reaches a point of no return. A place where if they continue they cannot ammend the previous confirmed information they have provided for their declaration of transit.

- The first round of user research found that 6 out of 6 users completely missed the context of the 'Before you continue' text.
- The second round of users 5 out of 6 users missed the 'Warning text'.
- Finally the 'Important notification banner' has successfully relayed the information to the users.

Focusing on a 'macro' interaction, allowed the team to provide the appropriate solution in order to achieve a 100% success task completion rate.

## Screenshots
